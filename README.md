# Simon Game

A desktop version of the classic Simon memory game, built using Java and JavaFX.

## Developed by
- Mazal Armias ([GitHub](https://github.com/ArmiasMazal))
- Hagar Yavin ([GitHub](https://github.com/hagaryavin))

This project was created as part of a university course in Java development and GUI programming.
The goal was to implement the logic, interface, and interaction of a memory-based color and sound game.

## Project Structure

The project includes three separate folders, each representing a part of the system:

- `/algorithm` – Game logic (sequence generation, validation) – written in Java  
- `/server` – Handles communication (if multiplayer or client-server variant exists)  
- `/gui` – JavaFX-based graphical interface, includes basic CSS styling

To run the game, download all folders and open them using an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code with JavaFX configured.

## How to Play
1. Run the server (if applicable).
2. Launch the GUI client.
3. Click "Start" to begin.
4. Follow the sequence of colors and sounds shown by the computer.
5. Repeat the sequence correctly to move to the next level.
6. A wrong move ends the game.

## Tech Stack

- JavaFX (for GUI)  
- CSS (basic styling)  
- IntelliJ IDEA
